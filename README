# Installation

Install gazebo or drcsim if you haven't already done so already.

http://gazebosim.org/wiki/Install

Dependencies: sudo apt-get install the following:
* libjansson-dev
* nodejs
* npm
* libboost-dev

    sudo apt-get install libjansson-dev nodejs npm libboost-dev

Install nodejs modules

    npm install http-server -g
    npm install -g node-gyp

From the gzweb root directory

    npm install websocket

# Build

The first time you build, you'll need to gather all the gazebo models and
put them in the right directory and prepare them for the web. To do this,
you'll need to source the gazebo/drcsim setup.sh files, and run a deploy script.

    ./deploy.sh -m

Note the `-m` flag tells the deploy script to grab models from the model
database and any other models in your gazebo paths. For all subsequent builds,
the `-m` flag will not be needed, i.e.:

    ./deploy.sh

# Running gzserver, gzweb, and webgl

Start gazebo or gzserver first

     gzserver

Start the http and websocket servers

    ./start_gzweb.sh

Open a browser that has webgl support and point it to the ip address and port
where the http server is started, by default it's on port 8080, e.g.

http://localhost:8080


# Stopping gzweb server

    ./stop_gzweb.sh
