# Build

The first time you build, you'll need to download all the models from the
model database and prepare them for the web, so run the deploy script with the
`-m` flag.

$ ./deploy -m

for all subsequent builds:

$ ./deploy

# Running gzserver, gzweb, and webgl

Start gazebo or gzserver first
$ gzserver

Start the http and websocket servers
$ ./start_gzweb

Open a browser that has webgl support and point it to the ip address and port
where the http server is started, by default it's on port 8080, e.g.

http://localhost:8080
