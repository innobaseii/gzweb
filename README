# Installation

Dependencies: sudo apt-get install the following:
- libjasson-dev (gzbridge)
- nodejs
- npm

Install nodejs' http-server and websocket
npm install http-server -g
npm install websocket

# Build

The first time you build, you'll need to download all the models from the
model database and prepare them for the web, so run the deply script with the
`-m` flag.

$ ./deploy -m

for all subsequent builds:

$ ./deploy

# Running gzserver, gzweb, and webgl

Start gazebo or gzserver first
$ gzserver

Start the websocket server that connects to gzserver
$ ./start_gzweb

Open a browser and point it to the ip address and port where the http server
is started. By default it's on port 8080, e.g.

http://localhost:8080
