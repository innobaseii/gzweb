Build Environment Setup
=======================

From the `gzweb/gz3d/utils directory`, run:

      npm install

Code Check and Mnification
==========================

From the `gzweb/gz3d/utils directory`, run:

      grunt build

You should see the message `Done, without errors` if the grunt tasks ran sucessfully. This produces `gz3d.js` and `gz3d.min.js` in the `gzweb/gz3d/build` folder.
